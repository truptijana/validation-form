MY project was to create and design a LOGIN/SIGN IN Form using HTML,CSS and Validating it using Javascript
Firstly LOGIN/SIGN IN form is created using HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
For the form two input fields are created Username and Password.
Both the input fields should satisfy some condition i,e for username field username must not be empty and must not have less than 4 character and cannot be only numer,similarly for password field password cannot be empty and should not have less than 8 characters and must contain alphanumeric values and must have special character.
The button should be disabled untill all validation rules are satisfied.
The button should be enabled after all condition are satisfied.
Upon Successfull validation form gives success message.
Visual Studio is used to run this code.
